# 4-ways-of-approaching-a-"3d-travelling-salesman"-problem_ Python 2.7
Organising 1000 RGB colours using, Random Search, Hill Climb, Iterated Local Search and Genetic Algorithms

Program is written in Python 2.7 and requires the colours.txt file to be in the same directory.

All options are clear at the top of the file
Box plots will only  be created if 5 or more runs are selected.


Some more work needs to be done with the GA for it to function properly.

Suggestions welcome!!!!
